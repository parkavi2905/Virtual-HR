## Project Overview

Virtual HR is an AI-driven platform that streamlines the recruitment process for software engineering roles. Our platform leverages cutting-edge technologies to automate various stages of recruitment, including:

- Resume analysis 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for virtual interviews
- Predicting candidate behavior
- Automated aptitude and programming skill assessments

By automating these tasks, Virtual HR aims to reduce the time and effort required to identify and hire the best candidates.

## Features

- **Automated Resume Analysis**: Quickly extract key information from resumes using CBF algorithm.
- **Virtual Interviews**: Conduct initial candidate interviews through NLP-driven chatbots.
- **Behavior Prediction**: Uses Attention Mechanism algorithm to predict candidate behavior and suitability.
- **Skill Assessments**: Automatically evaluate candidates' aptitude and programming skills with custom tests.

## Algorithms Used

- Content-Based Filtering
- NLP
- Attention Mechanism
  
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Windows, macOS or Linux for end-users.
- **Python IDLE**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
- **WAMP Server**: Install WAMP server for handling the backend. Download it from the [official website](http://www.wampserver.com/en/).
